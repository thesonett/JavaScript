# Learning JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for web development to make websites interactive and dynamic.
- Multi-paradigm: functional & object-oriented style.
- Dynamically typed: Variable types are determined at runtime.
- Interpreted: Code is run line by line, without needing to compile.

## Is It Object Oriented or Prototype-based?
- âœ… JavaScript is prototype-based.
- In JavaScript, objects are created from other objects using prototypes. Every object can serve as a prototype for another object. Every object in JavaScript has an internal link to another object called its prototype. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript looks for it in the object. If not found, it looks up the prototype chain.
- But JS also has classes, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) but this is just syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. Under the hood, it's still using prototypes.
- JavaScript is object-oriented via prototype-based inheritance.
